# Developer Workflow Gaps for OpenShift Deployment and Testing

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Research Category**: Development Process  
**Priority**: Critical (Blocking development efficiency)  
**Status**: Active Research  

## üéØ **Research Context**

### **Problem Statement**
We just added new middleware endpoints (`/api/pipeline/config` and `/api/pipeline/validate-parameters`) but they're not available in OpenShift because we haven't built and deployed the changes. This highlights a critical gap in our developer workflow - there's no automated CI/CD process for code changes.

### **Current Workflow Issues**
- ‚úÖ Code changes made locally
- ‚ùå No automated build process
- ‚ùå Manual deployment steps required
- ‚ùå No testing workflow for middleware changes
- ‚ùå Missing CI/CD integration

## üîç **Critical Research Questions**

### **Phase 1: Current State Analysis**

#### **Q1: Build and Deployment Process**
- **Q1.1**: What is the current process for building and deploying code changes to OpenShift?
- **Q1.2**: Are there existing BuildConfigs or CI/CD pipelines we should be using?
- **Q1.3**: How do we trigger builds when code changes are made?

#### **Q2: Testing Workflow Gaps**
- **Q2.1**: How should we test middleware changes before deploying to OpenShift?
- **Q2.2**: What testing environments are available (dev, staging, prod)?
- **Q2.3**: How do we validate that new endpoints work correctly in OpenShift?

#### **Q3: Developer Experience Issues**
- **Q3.1**: What manual steps are developers currently required to perform?
- **Q3.2**: How long does it take from code change to deployed functionality?
- **Q3.3**: What tools and scripts are missing to streamline the workflow?

### **Phase 2: Workflow Design Requirements**

#### **Q4: CI/CD Pipeline Design**
- **Q4.1**: Should we use OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) for CI/CD or external tools?
- **Q4.2**: What triggers should initiate builds (git push, manual, scheduled)?
- **Q4.3**: How should we handle different environments (dev, staging, prod)?

#### **Q5: Build Process Optimization**
- **Q5.1**: Should builds happen in OpenShift or externally?
- **Q5.2**: How do we handle dependencies and caching for faster builds?
- **Q5.3**: What build strategies work best for Quarkus applications?

#### **Q6: Testing Integration**
- **Q6.1**: How do we integrate automated testing into the build pipeline?
- **Q6.2**: What types of tests should run (unit, integration, e2e)?
- **Q6.3**: How do we test middleware endpoints before deployment?

### **Phase 3: Implementation Strategy**

#### **Q7: Immediate Solutions**
- **Q7.1**: What's the fastest way to deploy our current middleware changes?
- **Q7.2**: How can we manually trigger a build for the workshop-monitoring-service?
- **Q7.3**: What scripts or commands do we need to streamline deployment?

#### **Q8: Long-term Automation**
- **Q8.1**: How do we set up automated builds triggered by code changes?
- **Q8.2**: What monitoring and alerting should we add for build/deploy failures?
- **Q8.3**: How do we handle rollbacks when deployments fail?

## üìä **Current Findings**

### **Existing Infrastructure**
```yaml
# Found in OpenShift
BuildConfigs: 
  - workshop-monitoring-service-build (exists)
  
ImageStreams:
  - workshop-monitoring-service (exists)
  
Deployments:
  - workshop-monitoring-service (running but outdated)
```

### **Missing Components**
```yaml
Missing Workflows:
  - Automated build triggers
  - Code change detection
  - Testing pipeline integration
  - Deployment automation
  - Rollback procedures
```

### **Immediate Blockers**
1. **New middleware endpoints not available** - Need to rebuild service
2. **Manual build process** - No automation for code changes
3. **No testing workflow** - Can't validate changes before deployment
4. **Missing developer scripts** - No streamlined deployment process

## üöÄ **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Today: Manual Deployment**
1. **Trigger Manual Build**
   ```bash
   # Check existing build config
   oc get bc workshop-monitoring-service -n workshop-system
   
   # Start new build
   oc start-build workshop-monitoring-service -n workshop-system
   
   # Monitor build progress
   oc logs -f bc/workshop-monitoring-service -n workshop-system
   ```

2. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check if new image is deployed
   oc rollout status deployment/workshop-monitoring-service -n workshop-system
   
   # Test new endpoints
   curl -k https://workshop-monitoring-service-workshop-system.apps.cluster-9cfzr.9cfzr.sandbox180.opentlc.com/api/pipeline/config
   ```

### **This Week: Workflow Automation**
1. **Create Build Automation Scripts**
   - Script to trigger builds from jumpbox
   - Automated testing of endpoints
   - Deployment verification scripts

2. **Implement Basic CI/CD**
   - Set up build triggers
   - Add basic testing pipeline
   - Create deployment automation

### **Next Week: Advanced Workflows**
1. **Full CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated builds on code changes
   - Comprehensive testing integration
   - Multi-environment deployment

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### **Immediate (Today)**
- ‚úÖ New middleware endpoints available in OpenShift
- ‚úÖ Manual build and deployment process documented
- ‚úÖ Endpoints tested and working

### **Short-term (1 week)**

- ‚úÖ Basic CI/CD pipeline operational
- ‚úÖ Developer workflow documented

### **Long-term (2-3 weeks)**
- ‚úÖ Full automation from code to deployment
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing integration
- ‚úÖ Monitoring and alerting for builds
