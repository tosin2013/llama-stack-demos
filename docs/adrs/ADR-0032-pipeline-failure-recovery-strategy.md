# ADR-0032: Pipeline Failure Recovery and Resilience Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The Workshop Template System's Tekton pipelines show a pattern of failures in OpenShift, with multiple workflow runs failing while some succeed. Current evidence from the cluster shows:

- Multiple `workflow-1-intelligent-workshop-run-*` failures
- Mixed success/failure patterns in pipeline execution
- Last successful run: `workflow-1-simple-corrected-run-xs24j`
- No documented recovery procedures or failure analysis

The system lacks a formal strategy for handling pipeline failures, recovery procedures, and resilience mechanisms. This impacts user experience and system reliability.

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive pipeline failure recovery and resilience strategy that includes:

### 1. Automated Failure Detection and Classification
- Categorize failures by type (infrastructure, code, configuration, resource)
- Implement failure pattern recognition
- Create failure severity levels (critical, high, medium, low)

### 2. Retry Mechanisms with Exponential Backoff
- Automatic retry for transient failures (3 attempts)
- Exponential backoff: 30s, 2m, 5m intervals
- Circuit breaker after 3 consecutive failures

### 3. Detailed Failure Logging and Alerting
- Structured logging for all pipeline failures
- Real-time alerts for critical failures
- Failure trend analysis and reporting

### 4. Automated Recovery Procedures
- Workspace cleanup for failed runs
- Resource deallocation and reallocation
- Automatic rollback to last known good state

### 5. Manual Intervention Escalation
- Clear escalation paths for unresolved failures
- Human-in-the-loop integration for complex failures
- Expert notification system

### 6. Post-Failure Analysis
- Automated failure report generation
- Root cause analysis workflows
- Continuous improvement feedback loop

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved system reliability and uptime
- Reduced manual intervention requirements
- Faster recovery from failures
- Better user experience with transparent error handling
- Systematic improvement of pipeline stability over time
- Reduced operational burden on DevOps team

### Negative
- Additional complexity in pipeline design and maintenance
- Increased resource usage for monitoring and retry mechanisms
- Potential for masking underlying issues if not properly configured
- Additional development and testing effort required

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual failure handling only**: Simple but not scalable
2. **Simple retry without classification**: May waste resources on permanent failures
3. **Circuit breaker pattern only**: Insufficient for comprehensive resilience

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (Week 1)
- Implement basic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add structured failure logging
- Create failure classification system

### Phase 2: Short-term (Week 2-3)
- Implement circuit breaker patterns
- Add automated workspace cleanup
- Create alerting system

### Phase 3: Long-term (Week 4+)
- Implement trend analysis
- Add predictive failure detection
- Create comprehensive reporting dashboard

- Mean time to recovery (MTTR): <5 minutes
- False positive alert rate: <5%
- User satisfaction with error handling: >4.0/5.0
