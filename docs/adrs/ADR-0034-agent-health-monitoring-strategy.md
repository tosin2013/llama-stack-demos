# ADR-0034: Agent Health Monitoring and Auto-Recovery Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The Workshop Template System consists of 6 core agents deployed in OpenShift:
- workshop-chat-agent (2 replicas)
- content-creator-agent
- template-converter-agent
- source-manager-agent
- research-validation-agent
- documentation-pipeline-agent

Currently, the system lacks comprehensive health monitoring and auto-recovery mechanisms. While individual agents have basic health endpoints, there's no systematic monitoring, alerting, or automated recovery procedures.

Evidence from current deployment:
- All 6 agents are running but health status is not systematically monitored
- No automated recovery procedures for failed agents
- Manual intervention required for troubleshooting agent issues
- No visibility into agent performance and resource utilization

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive agent health monitoring and auto-recovery strategy:

### 1. Standardized Health Check Framework
- Implement consistent health endpoints across all agents
- Multi-level health checks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes
- Custom health indicators for agent-specific functionality
- Health check aggregation and reporting

### 2. Automated Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time health status monitoring dashboard
- Proactive alerting for agent failures or degraded performance
- Health trend analysis and predictive alerting
- Integration with OpenShift monitoring stack

### 3. Auto-Recovery Mechanisms
- Automatic pod restart for failed health checks
- Circuit breaker patterns for inter-agent communication
- Graceful degradation when agents are unavailable
- Automatic scaling based on load and health metrics

### 4. Performance and Resource Monitoring
- CPU, memory, and network utilization tracking
- Response time and throughput monitoring
- Resource limit optimization based on actual usage
- Capacity planning and scaling recommendations

### 5. Operational Dashboards and Reporting
- Real-time agent status dashboard
- Historical performance and availability reports
- SLA monitoring and compliance reporting
- Troubleshooting guides and runbooks

## Implementation Details

### Health Check Endpoints
```yaml
# Standard health endpoints for all agents
/health          # Overall health status
/health/live     # Liveness probe
/health/ready    # Readiness probe
/health/started  # Startup probe
/metrics         # Prometheus metrics
```

### Kubernetes Probe Configuration
```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/live
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  failureThreshold: 3

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 3
  failureThreshold: 3
```

### Monitoring Stack Integration
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards
- AlertManager for alerting and notifications
- OpenShift monitoring integration

### Auto-Recovery Policies
```yaml
# Restart policy for failed agents
restartPolicy: Always
# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for scaling
minReplicas: 1
maxReplicas: 3
targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved system reliability through proactive monitoring
- Reduced downtime with automated recovery mechanisms
- Better visibility into system health and performance
- Faster incident response and resolution
- Optimized resource utilization and cost efficiency
- Enhanced user experience with more stable service

### Negative
- Additional complexity in deployment and configuration
- Increased resource overhead for monitoring infrastructure
- Potential alert fatigue if not properly tuned
- Additional maintenance overhead for monitoring stack

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Health Monitoring (Week 1)
- Standardize health endpoints across all agents
- Configure Kubernetes probes for all deployments
- Implement basic monitoring dashboard

### Phase 2: Advanced Monitoring (Week 2)
- Integrate with Prometheus and Grafana
- Implement custom metrics and alerting
- Add performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Auto-Recovery (Week 3)
- Implement circuit breaker patterns
- Configure horizontal pod autoscaling
- Add graceful degradation mechanisms

### Phase 4: Operational Excellence (Week 4)
- Create comprehensive dashboards
- Implement SLA monitoring
- Develop troubleshooting runbooks

## Success Metrics

### Availability Targets
- Agent uptime: >99.5%
- Mean time to detection (MTTD): <2 minutes
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR): <5 minutes
- False positive alert rate: <5%

### Performance Targets
- Health check response time: <100ms
- Agent response time: <2 seconds
- Resource utilization: 60-80% of allocated resources
