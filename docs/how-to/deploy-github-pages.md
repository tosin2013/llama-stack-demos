# How to Deploy Workshops to GitHub Pages

Learn how to export and deploy workshops to GitHub Pages for free static hosting while maintaining an upgrade path to enhanced OpenShift features.

## üéØ When to Use GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages deployment is ideal for:
- **Wide Distribution**: Free hosting accessible to everyone
- **Cost-Conscious Projects**: No infrastructure costs
- **Pilot Programs**: Test workshop reception before investing in enhanced features
- **Simple Workshops**: Content-focused workshops without need for real-time assistance
- **Offline Access**: Participants can download and use offline

## üìã Prerequisites

- Workshop created using the Workshop Template System
- GitHub repository (public for free GitHub Pages)
- Source Manager Agent running (Port 10060)

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Export Process

### Step 1: Export Workshop for GitHub Pages

Use the Source Manager Agent to export your workshop:

```bash
# Export workshop for GitHub Pages
curl -X POST http://localhost:10060/send-task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "export-001",
    "params": {
      "id": "export-001",
      "sessionId": "github-pages-export",
      "message": {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Export healthcare-ml-workshop for GitHub Pages deployment with upgrade information"
        }]
      },
      "acceptedOutputModes": ["text/plain"]
    }
  }'
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Create New Repository**:
   - Go to GitHub.com ‚Üí New Repository
   - Name: `healthcare-ml-workshop` (or your workshop name)
   - Visibility: Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - Initialize with README: No (we'll add our own)

2. **Clone Repository Locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-ml-workshop.git
   cd healthcare-ml-workshop
   ```

### Step 3: Upload Exported Content

```bash
# Copy exported files to repository
cp -r ./github-pages-export/* ./healthcare-ml-workshop/

# Add and commit files
cd healthcare-ml-workshop
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Healthcare ML workshop to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click "Save"

3. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - GitHub will build and deploy your site
   - Process takes 5-10 minutes
   - You'll receive an email when complete

### Step 5: Access Your Workshop

Your workshop will be available at:
```
https://yourusername.github.io/healthcare-ml-workshop
```
