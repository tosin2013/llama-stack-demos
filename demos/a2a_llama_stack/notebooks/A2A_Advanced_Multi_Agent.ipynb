    "# Advanced Multi-Agent Orchestration with A2A and Llama Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to construct and orchestrate a multi-agent system using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol. We will build individual agents using Llama Stack and then enable them to collaborate on complex tasks by exposing their functionalities via A2A servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This demo focuses on an orchestration pattern where a planner agent determines which specialized agent (skill) to call, and a composer agent formats the final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Setting up the Llama Stack Environment**: Initializing the Llama Stack client and configuring model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Defining Llama Stack Agents**: Creating three distinct Llama Stack agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `Planner Agent`: Responsible for interpreting user queries and creating a plan to use other agents' skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `Custom Tool Agent`: Equipped with tools for random number generation and date retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `Composer Agent`: Skilled at generating human-friendly text from structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Serving Llama Stack Agents via A2A**: Exposing each Llama Stack agent over an individual A2A server, making their `AgentCard` skills accessible via the A2A protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Orchestrating the A2A Agents**: Setting up an `AgentManager` to manage communication with the A2A-enabled agents and implementing an `orchestrate` function to coordinate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Running the Orchestration**: Launching the multi-agent system to answer user queries, leveraging the planner to select tools/skills and the composer to generate a final, human-readable response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "- `python_requires >= 3.13`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Followed the instructions in the [Setup Guide](../../rag_agentic/notebooks/Level0_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional environment variables\n",
    "This demo requires the following environment variables in addition to those defined in the [Setup Guide](../../rag_agentic/notebooks/Level0_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PLANNER_AGENT_LOCAL_PORT`: The port for the A2A agent responsible for planning (e.g. 10020).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CUSTOM_TOOL_AGENT_LOCAL_PORT`: The port for the A2A agent with custom tool capabilities (e.g. 10021).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `COMPOSER_AGENT_LOCAL_PORT`: The port for the A2A agent responsible for composing final answers (e.g. 10022)."

    "## 6. Wrapping Up & Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "We've successfully orchestrated a team of specialized Llama Stack agents, showcasing how they can collaborate via the A2A protocol to tackle complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Achieved:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* We configured the Llama Stack environment and designed three distinct agents: a `Planner`, a `Custom Tool Agent` (with date/random number skills), and a `Composer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each agent was made accessible through A2A, with an `AgentManager` and an `orchestrate` function guiding their interaction to deliver user-friendly answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is the power of modular, specialized agents communicating through a standard protocol, allowing for flexible and scalable AI system development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired? Here are a few ways to build on this foundation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Refine & Expand**: Experiment with agent instructions or add new tools and specialized agents to the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Boost Orchestration**: Explore more dynamic planning, such as conditional logic or inter-agent feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Challenge the System**: Test with increasingly complex queries to push the boundaries of the current setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a stepping stone into the exciting world of multi-agent AI. We hope it empowers you to build even more sophisticated applications. Happy coding!"
