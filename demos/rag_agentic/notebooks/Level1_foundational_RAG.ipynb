    "# Level 1: Foundational RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial presents an example of executing queries with foundational (i.e., non-agentic) RAG in Llama Stack. It shows how the APIs provided by Llama Stack can be used to directly control and invoke all RAG stages, including indexing, retrieval and inference. \n",
    "For an agentic RAG tutorial, please refer to [Level3_agentic_RAG.ipynb](demos/rag_agentic/notebooks/Level3_agentic_RAG.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the following steps:\n",
    "1. Connecting to a llama-stack server.\n",
    "2. Indexing a collection of documents in a vector DB for later retrieval.\n",
    "3. Executing the built-in RAG tool to retrieve the document chunks relevant to a given query.\n",
    "4. Using the retrieved context to answer user queries during the inference step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have a running instance of the Llama Stack server (local or remote) with at least one preconfigured vector DB. For more information, please refer to the corresponding [Llama Stack tutorials](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html)."

      "inference> To install OpenShift, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Download and install the OpenShift CLI (Command Line Interface) tool from the official Red Hat website.\n",
      "2. Create a new project in your OpenShift cluster using the `oc new-project` command.\n",
      "3. Install the OpenShift client tools on your system by running the `oc setup` command.\n",
      "4. Log in to your OpenShift cluster using the `oc login` command with your credentials.\n",
      "5. Create a new application in your project using the `oc new-app` command, specifying the image URL of the container you want to deploy.\n",
      "6. Once the application is created, you can access it through the OpenShift web console or by running the `oc expose` command.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, you can also use the odo tool provided by Red Hat to create and deploy applications on OpenShift. The odo tool allows you to create applications using \"Devfiles,\" which are YAML files that contain information about your application's programming language, dependencies, and other essential details.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can download the odo tool from the \"Help\" menu on the OpenShift web console through the \"Command line tools\" entry. Once installed, you can use the `odo init` command to create a new application using various programming languages, and then run the `odo push` command to build and deploy the container to the OpenShift container registry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The above steps are general instructions and may vary depending on your specific environment and configuration. It's recommended to refer to the official Red Hat documentation for more detailed instructions and troubleshooting guides.\n",
      "User> Are employees based in California eligible for remote work?\n",
      "inference> Based on the provided knowledge search tool results, it appears that there are specific regulations and considerations for employers in California regarding remote work. According to the results, California has laws that require employers to reimburse employees for necessary business expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of their duties, including internet usage, home electricity, computer equipment, and cell phone usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there are specific requirements for data security and privacy, as California has strong data protection laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). Employers must safeguard sensitive information and comply with these regulations, which apply regardless of where the employee works.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is not explicitly stated in the provided results whether employees based in California are eligible for remote work. The results seem to focus more on the responsibilities and considerations for employers rather than the eligibility of employees for remote work.\n",
