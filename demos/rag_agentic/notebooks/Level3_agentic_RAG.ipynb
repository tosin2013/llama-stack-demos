    "# Level 3: Agentic RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial presents an example of executing queries with agentic RAG in Llama Stack. It shows how to initialize an agent with the RAG tool provided by Llama Stack and to invoke it such that retrieval from a vector DB is activated when necessary. The tutorial also covers document ingestion using the RAG tool.\n",
    "For a foundational (non-agentic) RAG tutorial, please refer to [Level1_foundational_RAG.ipynb](demos/rag_agentic/notebooks/Level1_foundational_RAG.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the following steps:\n",
    "1. Connecting to a llama-stack server.\n",
    "2. Indexing a collection of documents in a vector DB for later retrieval.\n",
    "3. Initializing the agent capable of retrieving content from vector DB via tool use.\n",
    "4. Launching the agent and using it to answer user queries during the inference step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have a running instance of the Llama Stack server (local or remote) with at least one preconfigured vector DB. For more information, please refer to the corresponding [Llama Stack tutorials](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html)."

The\\n15\\ndocumentation at crc.dev/crc has more information about this subject.\\n7.2. Hardware Requirements\\nIn terms of hardware, OpenShift Local has some strict requirements. Your system must use a recent\\nIntel CPU (except for Macs, where Apple Silicon machines are supported) with at least four physical\\ncores and have at least 16 GB of RAM. Be aware that the base installation of OpenShift Local\\nrequires at least 9 GB free to start. Of course, to run other applications on OpenShift Local, you will\\nneed more RAM, so using a computer with at least 32 GB of RAM is strongly recommended.\\nOpenShift Local also requires at least 35 GB of free disk space for its installation. The memory\\nrequirements are likely to increase in the future, so please check the documentation at crc.dev for\\nmore up-to-date information.\\n7.3. Installation\\nTo install OpenShift Local, open your web browser and navigate to console.redhat.com/openshift/\\ncreate/local . Download the latest release of OpenShift Local and the \"pull secret\" file. The latter is a\\nfile containing a key identifying your copy of OpenShift Local to your Red Hat Developer account.\\nUnzip the file containing the OpenShift Local executable, and using your terminal, run the\\ncommand crc setup . This command will prepare your copy of OpenShift Local, verifying\\nrequirements and setting the required configuration values.\\nOnce the crc setup command is ready, launch crc start. Running crc start can take a long time,\\naround 20 minutes, on a recent PC.\\nOnce started, access the OpenShift Web Console with the crc console command, which will open\\nyour default browser. OpenShift Local uses the developer username and password to log in as a\\nlow-privilege user, while the kubeadmin user uses a random-generated password. Use the crc\\nconsole --credentials command to find the credentials required to log in as the kubeadmin user.\\nOpenShift Local allows developers to perform various everyday tasks as if it were a standard\\nOpenShift cluster, like deploying applications\\n'</span>,\n",

Is Red Hat OpenShift Open Source?\\nRed Hat OpenShift is a commercial product based on an open-source project called OKD. This\\nacronym means \" OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution\" and is publicly available for everyone to\\ninspect and contribute. Like the upstream Kubernetes project, OKD developers use the Go\\nprogramming language.\\n3.3. How can I run OpenShift?\\nToday, Red Hat OpenShift is available through various mechanisms and formats:\\n• DevOps teams can install it in their data centers \"on-premise.\"\\n• Major hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud offer managed\\nRed Hat OpenShift installations.\\n• Developers can either run OpenShift locally on their workstations using Red Hat OpenShift\\nLocal, also known as CRC or \"Code-Ready Containers\"\\n• They can also request a 30-day trial OpenShift cluster, offered by Red Hat, at no charge, for\\ntesting and evaluation purposes.\\nRed Hat OpenShift is an integrated Platform-as-a-Service for enterprise users based on Kubernetes.\\nIt is tightly integrated with advanced security settings, developer tooling, and monitoring\\nmechanisms, allowing DevOps teams to be more productive.\\n8\\nChapter 4. OpenShift-only Custom Resource\\nDefinitions\\nRed Hat OpenShift is a complete DevOps platform extending Kubernetes in various ways. It bundles\\na constellation of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to make the life of developers and cluster\\nadministrators easier.\\nLet us talk first about the CRDs only available on OpenShift.\\n4.1. Project\\nAn OpenShift Project is similar to a Kubernetes namespace, but more tightly integrated into the\\nsecurity system of OpenShift through additional annotations.\\napiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1\\nkind: Project\\nmetadata:\\n\\xa0 name: linkedin-learning-project\\n\\xa0 annotations:\\n\\xa0   openshift.io/description: \"Project description\"\\n\\xa0   openshift.io/display-name: \"Display name\"\\n4.2. Route\\nThe OpenShift Route object was one of the primary inspirations during the development of the\\nIngress object. In OpenShift, Ingress and Route objects work together to ensure your applications\\nare available outside the cluster.\\napiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1\\nkind: Route\\nmetadata:\\n\\xa0 name: my-route\\nspec:\\n\\xa0 host:\\n'</span>,\n",

Creating and Debugging Applications with the odo\\nTool\\nWith the oc tool, Red Hat provides another one geared toward software developers: the odo tool.\\nDevelopers can use the odo tool to create applications using \"Devfiles,\" particular files named\\n\"devfile.yaml\" based on an open standard available at the Devfiles website. Devfiles contain\\ninformation about your application’s programming language, dependencies, and other essential\\ndetails.\\n23\\nThe odo tool is not available by default on your command line, but you can download it from the\\n\"Help\" menu on the OpenShift Web Console through the \"Command line tools\" entry. Click on the\\n\"Download odo\" link at the bottom, and select the version of odo that corresponds to your system.\\nThe \"odo catalog list components was\" command shows the various programming languages and\\nframeworks supported off-the-box by \"odo.\"\\nThe odo init  command prompts the user for a new application using many programming\\nlanguages: .NET, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and TypeScript. The last command generates a\\nscaffold ready to be populated with the required logic. Finally, the odo push command builds and\\npushes the container to the OpenShift container registry, deploying\\n'</span>,\n",

The\\n15\\ndocumentation at crc.dev/crc has more information about this subject.\\n7.2. Hardware Requirements\\nIn terms of hardware, OpenShift Local has some strict requirements. Your system must use a recent\\nIntel CPU \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mexcept for Macs, where Apple Silicon machines are supported\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m with at least four physical\\ncores and have at least 16 GB of RAM. Be aware that the base installation of OpenShift Local\\nrequires at least 9 GB free to start. Of course, to run other applications on OpenShift Local, you will\\nneed more RAM, so using a computer with at least 32 GB of RAM is strongly recommended.\\nOpenShift Local also requires at least 35 GB of free disk space for its installation. The memory\\nrequirements are likely to increase in the future, so please check the documentation at crc.dev for\\nmore up-to-date information.\\n7.3. Installation\\nTo install OpenShift Local, open your web browser and navigate to console.redhat.com/openshift/\\ncreate/local . Download the latest release of OpenShift Local and the \"pull secret\" file. The latter is a\\nfile containing a key identifying your copy of OpenShift Local to your Red Hat Developer account.\\nUnzip the file containing the OpenShift Local executable, and using your terminal, run the\\ncommand crc setup . This command will prepare your copy of OpenShift Local, verifying\\nrequirements and setting the required configuration values.\\nOnce the crc setup command is ready, launch crc start. Running crc start can take a long time,\\naround 20 minutes, on a recent PC.\\nOnce started, access the OpenShift Web Console with the crc console command, which will open\\nyour default browser. OpenShift Local uses the developer username and password to log in as a\\nlow-privilege user, while the kubeadmin user uses a random-generated password. Use the crc\\nconsole --credentials command to find the credentials required to log in as the kubeadmin user.\\nOpenShift Local allows developers to perform various everyday tasks as if it were a standard\\nOpenShift cluster, like deploying applications\\n'\u001b[0m,\n",

Is Red Hat OpenShift Open Source?\\nRed Hat OpenShift is a commercial product based on an open-source project called OKD. This\\nacronym means \" OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution\" and is publicly available for everyone to\\ninspect and contribute. Like the upstream Kubernetes project, OKD developers use the Go\\nprogramming language.\\n3.3. How can I run OpenShift?\\nToday, Red Hat OpenShift is available through various mechanisms and formats:\\n• DevOps teams can install it in their data centers \"on-premise.\"\\n• Major hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud offer managed\\nRed Hat OpenShift installations.\\n• Developers can either run OpenShift locally on their workstations using Red Hat OpenShift\\nLocal, also known as CRC or \"Code-Ready Containers\"\\n• They can also request a 30-day trial OpenShift cluster, offered by Red Hat, at no charge, for\\ntesting and evaluation purposes.\\nRed Hat OpenShift is an integrated Platform-as-a-Service for enterprise users based on Kubernetes.\\nIt is tightly integrated with advanced security settings, developer tooling, and monitoring\\nmechanisms, allowing DevOps teams to be more productive.\\n8\\nChapter 4.

Expense Reimbursement\\nCalifornia Labor Code Section 2802 requires employers to reimburse employees\\nfor “all necessary business expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in\\ndirect consequence of the discharge of his or her duties.” For remote workers, this\\nmay include internet usage, home electricity, computer equipment, and cell phone\\nusage. Employers should provide employees with the necessary supplies and\\nequipment needed to perform their job remotely, and either (1) make employees\\naware of the procedure for expensing incidental expenses, or (2) provide a\\nmonthly stipend for incidental expenses like cell phone, electricity and internet at\\nhome ($25 is a good amount). Make sure you do not have any antiquated policies\\nthat say home expenses are not reimbursable. If an employee chooses to work\\nfrom home, they may not have the same rights to reimbursement as an employee\\nwhose home is their assigned workspace.\\nCompliance Strategies\\n      • Establish a comprehensive expense reimbursement policy that outlines \\n      eligible expenses and the reimbursement process.\\nNavigating Remote Work Challenges: Top Five Issues for California Employers\\n      • Maintain clear communication with remote employees about the \\n      reimbursement policy and procedures.\\n      • Keep detailed records of reimbursed expenses and any accommodation \\n      related correspondence.\\n3.

Employers should provide employees with the necessary supplies and\\nequipment needed to perform their job remotely, and either \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m1\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m make employees\\naware of the procedure for expensing incidental expenses, or \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m2\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m provide a\\nmonthly stipend for incidental expenses like cell phone, electricity and internet at\\nhome \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32m$25 is a good amount\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.

Data Security and Privacy\\nRemote work can pose significant challenges regarding\\ndata security and privacy. California has strong data\\nprotection laws, such as the California Consumer\\nPrivacy Act \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mCCPA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m and the California Privacy Rights\\nAct \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mCPRA\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m.
