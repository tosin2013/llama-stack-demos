    "# Level 5: MCP Based RAG (Medium Difficulty)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an extension of the [Level 4 Agentic & MCP notebook](./Level4_agentic_and_mcp.ipynb) with the addition of RAG.\n",
    "This tutorial is for developers who are already familiar with [basic Agentic workflows](./Level2_simple_agentic_with_websearch.ipynb). This tutorial will highlight a couple of slightly more advanced use cases for agents where a single tool call is insufficient to complete the required task. Here we will rely on both agentic RAG and MCP server to expand our agents capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the following steps:\n",
    "1. Review Review OpenShift logs for a failing pod.\n",
    "2. Categorize the pod and summarize its error.\n",
    "3. Search available troubleshooting documentations for ideas on how to resolve the error.\n",
    "4. Send a Slack message to the ops team with a brief summary of the error and next steps to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook we will be relying on the [kuberenetes-mcp-server](https://github.com/manusa/kubernetes-mcp-server) by [manusa](https://github.com/manusa) to interact with our OpenShift cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be using the [Slack MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/slack) in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "- A running Llama Stack server\n",
    "- A running Slack MCP server. Refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-demos/tree/main/kubernetes/mcp-servers/slack-mcp) on how you can set this up on your OpenShift cluster\n",
    "- Access to an OpeShift cluster with a deployment of the [OpenShift MCP server](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-on-ocp/tree/main/mcp-servers/openshift) (see the [deployment manifests](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-on-ocp/tree/main/kubernetes/mcp-servers/openshift-mcp) for assistance with this).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting your ENV variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [.env.example](../../../.env.example) to create a new file called `.env` and ensure you add all the relevant environment variables below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the environment variables listed in the [\"Getting Started\" notebook](demos/rag_agentic/notebooks/Level0_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb), the following should be provided for this demo to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `REMOTE` (boolean): dictates if you are using a remote llama-stack instance.\n",
    "- `REMOTE_BASE_URL` (string): the URL for your llama-stack instance if using remote connection.\n",
    "- `REMOTE_OCP_MCP_URL` (string): the URL for your Openshift MCP server. If the client does not find the tool registered to the llama-stack instance, it will use this URL to register the Openshift tool (used in demos 1 and 3).\n",
    "- `REMOTE_SLACK_MCP_URL` (string): the URL for your Slack MCP server. If the client does not find the tool registered to the llama-stack instance, it will use this URL to register the Slack tool (used in demo 3).\n",
    "- `USE_PROMPT_CHAINING` (boolean): dictates if the prompt should be formatted as 3 separate prompts to isolate each step or in a single turn. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up the Environment,\n",
    "We will initialize our environment as described in detail in our [\\\"Getting Started\\\" notebook](demos/rag_agentic/notebooks/Level0_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb). Please refer to it for additional explanations."

    "1. First the LLM sends off a tool call to the pods_log tool configured with the OpenShift MCP server, to fetch the logs for the pod specified from the OpenShift cluster.\n",
    "2. The tool successfully retrieves the logs for the pod.\n",
    "3. The LLM recieves the response from the tool call, which are the pod logs, along with the original query.\n",
    "4. The LLM sends a tool call to the RAG tool, to query the vector DB on the error from the pod.\n",
    "5. The LLM recieves the response from the tool call, and summarizes the information into steps to take.\n",
    "6. Finally, the LLM performs a final inference on the context. The inference result provides the final answer in a structured table format as requested in the user prompt and provides the pod name, its category of 'Normal' or 'Error' along with a brief explanantion and results from the vector db."

We do so by initializing an agent while giving it access to the MCP tools, and RAG tool configured with Llama Stack, then invoking the agent on each of the specified queries. Please check out our other notebooks for more examples using Llama Stack."
