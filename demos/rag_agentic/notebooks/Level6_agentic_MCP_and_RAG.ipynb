    "# Level 5: MCP Based RAG (Medium Difficulty)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an extension of the [Level 5 Agentic & MCP notebook](./Level5_agentic_and_mcp.ipynb) with the addition of RAG.\n",
    "This tutorial is for developers who are already familiar with [agentic RAG workflows](./Level4_agentic_RAG.ipynb). This tutorial will highlight a couple of slightly more advanced use cases for agents where a single tool call is insufficient to complete the required task. Here we will rely on both agentic RAG and MCP server to expand our agents capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the following steps:\n",
    "1. Review Review OpenShift logs for a failing pod.\n",
    "2. Categorize the pod and summarize its error.\n",
    "3. Search available troubleshooting documentations for ideas on how to resolve the error.\n",
    "4. Send a Slack message to the ops team with a brief summary of the error and next steps to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenShift MCP Server\n",
    "Throughout this notebook we will be relying on the [kuberenetes-mcp-server](https://github.com/manusa/kubernetes-mcp-server) by [manusa](https://github.com/manusa) to interact with our OpenShift cluster. Please see installation instructions below if you do not already have this deployed in your environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "* [OpenShift MCP installation instructions](../../../mcp-servers/openshift/README.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slack MCP Server\n",
    "We will also be using the [Slack MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/slack) in this notebook. Please see installation instructions below if you do not already have this deployed in your environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Slack MCP installation instructions](../../../mcp-servers/slack/README.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "- A running Llama Stack server\n",
    "- A running Slack MCP server. Refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-demos/tree/main/kubernetes/mcp-servers/slack-mcp) on how you can set this up on your OpenShift cluster\n",
    "- Access to an OpeShift cluster with a deployment of the [OpenShift MCP server](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-on-ocp/tree/main/mcp-servers/openshift) (see the [deployment manifests](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-on-ocp/tree/main/kubernetes/mcp-servers/openshift-mcp) for assistance with this).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting your ENV variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [.env.example](../../../.env.example) to create a new file called `.env` and ensure you add all the relevant environment variables below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the environment variables listed in the [\"Getting Started\" notebook](demos/rag_agentic/notebooks/Level0_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb), the following should be provided for this demo to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `REMOTE` (boolean): dictates if you are using a remote llama-stack instance.\n",
    "- `REMOTE_BASE_URL` (string): the URL for your llama-stack instance if using remote connection.\n",
    "- `REMOTE_OCP_MCP_URL` (string): the URL for your Openshift MCP server. If the client does not find the tool registered to the llama-stack instance, it will use this URL to register the Openshift tool (used in demos 1 and 3).\n",
    "- `REMOTE_SLACK_MCP_URL` (string): the URL for your Slack MCP server. If the client does not find the tool registered to the llama-stack instance, it will use this URL to register the Slack tool (used in demo 3).\n",
    "- `USE_PROMPT_CHAINING` (boolean): dictates if the prompt should be formatted as 3 separate prompts to isolate each step or in a single turn. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up the Environment\n",
    "We will initialize our environment as described in detail in our [\\\"Getting Started\\\" notebook](demos/rag_agentic/notebooks/Level0_getting_started_with_Llama_Stack.ipynb). Please refer to it for additional explanations."
